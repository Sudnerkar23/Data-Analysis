**Interpretation:**

In summary, the data reveals the following key insights:

-   **Right-Skewed Distributions:**

    Most metrics (Minutes Played, Goals, Assists, Penalty Goals, Clean Sheets) exhibit right-skewed distributions, indicating that a few players have significantly higher values than the rest.

-   **Variability:**

    High variability is observed in Minutes Played, Appearances, Goals, Assists, and Clean Sheets, suggesting a wide range of player performance.

-   **Age and Appearances:**

    Age and Appearances show more symmetrical distributions, indicating a more even spread of values.

These insights highlight the importance of considering both central tendency (mean, median) and variability (SD, IQR) when analyzing player performance data.

)

# Adding a continent column to the dataset
players_data <- players_data %>%
  mutate(continent = continent_mapping[nationality])  
# Assign continent based on nationality mapping



# Filtering out English players and group by continent
international_players <- players_data %>%
  filter(nationality != "England" & !is.na(continent)) %>%
  count(continent) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# Generating a color palette for all continents using "Paired" palette
colors <- brewer.pal(length(unique(international_players$continent)),"Paired")

# Plotting pie chart with custom color palette
ggplot(international_players, aes(x = "", y = n, fill = continent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +  # Apply the custom color palette
  labs(title = "Distribution of International Players by Continent 
       (Excluding England)",
       x = "", y = "") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())

```

**Interpretation of Pie Chart:**

The pie chart titled **"Distribution of International Players by Continent (Excluding England)"** shows the breakdown of international players across different continents, excluding players from England.

Here's what we can interpret from the chart:

**Dominance of Europe:**

-   The largest slice of the pie is occupied by **Europe**, indicating that a significant portion of international players come from this continent.

**Other Notable Continents:**

-   **South America** has the second-largest share, suggesting a strong presence of players from this region.

-   **Africa** and **Asia** have noticeable segments, indicating a growing number of players from these continents.

**Overall:**

The chart highlights the global nature of international players, with a strong focus on European and South American players. It also suggests an increasing representation of players from Africa and Asia in the international scene.

**(ii) Minutes played by position (Bar Plot)**

```{r}
# Summarizing total minutes played by position
minutes_by_position <- players_data %>%
  group_by(position) %>%
  summarise(total_minutes = sum(minutes_played_overall, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_minutes))  # Sort by total minutes played

# Creating a bar plot to visualize the total minutes played by position
ggplot(minutes_by_position, aes(x = reorder(position, total_minutes), 
y = total_minutes, fill = position)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Total Minutes Played by Position", 
       x = "Position", 
       y = "Total Minutes Played") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +  
  # Rotating x-axis labels for better readability
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")  

```

**Interpretation:**

**Distribution of Playing Time:**

-   **Midfielders** have the highest total minutes played, indicating that they are heavily relied upon for playing time.

-   **Defenders** have the second-highest minutes played, suggesting a significant role in the team's strategy.

-   **Forwards** have a moderate amount of playing time.

-   **Goalkeepers** have the lowest total minutes played, which is expected as they are typically substituted less frequently.

**Overall:**

The chart highlights that the team's playing time is heavily concentrated on midfielders and defenders, with goalkeepers playing the least. This suggests a tactical approach that prioritizes possession and defensive stability.

**(iii) Age distribution of players (Histogram)**

```{r}
# Converting age to numeric if it's not already
players_data$age <- as.numeric(players_data$age)

# Plotting the distribution of player ages with a density line
ggplot(players_data, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), binwidth = 1, fill = "skyblue", 
                 color = "black", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_density(color = "red", linewidth = 1) +  # Add a density curve (line)
  labs(title = "Age Distribution of Players", x = "Age", y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()


```

**Interpretation:**

**Distribution of Ages:**

-   The distribution is **skewed to the right**, meaning there are more players in the younger age groups (20s and early 30s) compared to the older age groups.

-   The peak of the distribution lies between 25 and 30, indicating that this age range has the highest concentration of players.

-   There is a gradual decline in the number of players as the age increases, suggesting that fewer older players are present in the premier league.

**Overall:**

The chart highlights that the premier league has a younger player base, with a majority of players in their late 20s and early 30s. This suggests a focus on youth and potentially a strategy for long-term development.

**(iv) Top Scoring Clubs (Bar chart)**

```{r}

# Summarizing the total goals scored by each club
goals_by_club <- players_data %>%
  group_by(`Current.Club`) %>%
  summarise(total_goals = sum(goals_overall, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_goals))

# Selecting top clubs (e.g., top 10) for better visualization
top_clubs <- goals_by_club %>%
  head(10)

# Plotting the bar chart
ggplot(top_clubs, aes(x = reorder(`Current.Club`, total_goals), 
  y = total_goals, fill = `Current.Club`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +  # Flip the coordinates to make it horizontal
  labs(title = "Top 10 Clubs with Most Goals Scored",
       x = "Club", y = "Total Goals Scored") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # Remove legend since it's not needed here

```

**Interpretation:**

**Top-Scoring Clubs:**

-   **Manchester City** leads the chart with the highest number of goals scored.

-   **Liverpool** and **Arsenal** follow closely behind, occupying the second and third positions, respectively.

**Other Notable Clubs:**

-   **Tottenham Hotspur**, **Manchester United**, and **Chelsea** also have a significant number of goals scored, placing them in the top 5.

-   Clubs like **AFC Bournemouth**, **Everton**, **West Ham United**, and **Watford** have scored fewer goals compared to the top teams.

**Overall:**

**(v) Distribution of Total Goals by Player Position**

```{r}
# Summarizing total goals by position
position_goals <- players_data %>%
  group_by(position) %>%
  summarise(total_goals = sum(goals_overall, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_goals))

# Plotting pie chart of total goals by position
ggplot(position_goals, aes(x = "", y = total_goals, fill = position)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Total Goals by Player Position", x = "", y = "") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral")

```

**Interpretation:**

The pie chart titled "Distribution of Total Goals by Player Position" shows the proportion of goals scored by players in different positions.

Here's what we can interpret from the chart:

**Goal-Scoring Distribution:**

-   **Midfielders** have scored the highest proportion of goals, with a significant portion of the pie chart dedicated to them.

-   **Forwards** have the second-highest proportion of goals, indicating their key role in scoring.

1.  **`create_report()`**: To generate a comprehensive EDA report.

2.  **`plot_bar()`**: To create bar plots for categorical variables.

3.  **`plot_density()`**: To visualize density of numerical variables.

### 2.2.1: **Generating an Automated EDA Report**

The `create_report()` function generates a comprehensive report for the dataset, including summaries, visualizations, and key insights.

```{r,error=TRUE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Loading DataExplorer library
library(DataExplorer)

# Generating an automated EDA report
create_report(players_data)

```

**Explanation:**

-   This function creates a self-contained HTML report, which includes information about data structure, missing values, variable distributions, correlations, and other EDA insights.

-   The generated report can be opened in any browser for further exploration.

**Output:**

We will get an HTML file with visualizations like histograms, bar charts, missing data heatmaps, and correlation matrices, giving a complete overview of the dataset.

Here is the PDF version of full HTML Report File generated : [bit.ly/DataExplorerReport](https://bit.ly/DataExplorerReport)

### **2.2.3: Bar Plot for Categorical Variables**

The `plot_bar()` function creates bar plots for categorical variables, showing the frequency of each category.

```{r}
# Creating a new data frame with few categorical variables
categorical_vars <- players_data %>% select('Current.Club', 'position')

# Plotting bar charts for categorical variables
plot_bar(categorical_vars)

```

**Explanation**:

-   `plot_bar()` will create separate bar charts for each categorical variable in the `categorical_vars` data frame.

-   This helps visualize the frequency of each category within each variable (e.g., how many players belong to each team, or the number of players in each position).

**Output**:

-   A bar plot showing the distribution of players across teams (e.g., how many players are in `Arsenal`, `Liverpool`, etc.).

-   Another bar plot showing the distribution of player positions (e.g., Forward, Midfielder, Defender, etc.).

### **2.2.3: Density Plot for Numerical Variables**

```{r}
# Creating a new data frame with few numerical variables
numerical_vars <- players_data %>% select(goals_overall, appearances_overall,
assists_overall,age,minutes_played_overall,yellow_cards_overall,
penalty_goals,clean_sheets_overall)

# Visualizing the density of numerical variables
plot_density(numerical_vars)
```

**Explanation**:

-   `plot_density()` will generate smooth density plots for each of the selected numerical variables, helping you visualize the distribution (whether the data is normal, skewed, etc.).

-   This is useful for identifying patterns, such as whether most players scored only a few goals or played a similar number of matches.

**Output:**

The density plot shows the distribution of various numerical variables:

1.  **`age`**: Most players are aged 25–30, typical for professional footballers.

2.  **`appearances_overall`**: Most players have 0–10 appearances, with fewer having many appearances.

3.  **`assists_overall`**: The majority have 0 assists, with only a few players having more.

4.  **`clean_sheets_overall`**: Most players have 0 clean sheets, as this is mainly relevant for goalkeepers and defenders.

5.  **`goals_overall`**: Most players score few or no goals, with only a few scoring many.

6.  **`minutes_played_overall`**: Most players play fewer minutes, with only a few playing significant time.

7.  **`penalty_goals`**: Only a small number of players score penalty goals.

8.  **`yellow_cards_overall`**: Most players have few yellow cards, with a few accumulating many.

Overall, the data is right-skewed, with most players having low values in these categories, and a few standout performers.

## 2.3: Conclusion

The `DataExplorer` package greatly streamlined the **exploratory data analysis** process, automating key tasks like generating reports and visualizing trends. It provided a holistic view of the dataset by identifying **missing values**, correlations, and distributions with minimal manual effort. By automating repetitive tasks, the package enhanced **efficiency and clarity**, making it a powerful tool for data profiling.
